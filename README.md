# About

This is an application I made during my second year at the Linnaeus University.  
I made this for an assignment to learn to work with Express.

This application is a small web application that handles writing, updating and deleting code snippets.  
The application handles sessions for a login system and it handles security issues that was on the top-list OWASP and the most popular vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It protects for example against SQL Injections, XSS, CSRF-attacks, Brute Forcing and Rainbow tabling.  
  
Working with this application have taught me about vulnerabilities in applications and how to protect the people using the application and the application itself. It also helped me get an understanding about cookies, sessions and express in general.  
  
To run the application, simply run `node app.js` and browse to http://localhost:8000.  
It is connected to a dummy database with all the credentials in the files. (There for testing, not optimal otherwise)
